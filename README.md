# Scraping Top Repositories for GitHub Topics

Some companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow you to access their data in a predefined format like JSON, XML.
Python offers a variety of libraries to scrape the web such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, Scrapy, Selenium. If you are starting with web scraping, then Beautiful Soup will be the easy option. Also, if you are building big projects, Beautiful Soup won’t be a wise option as they are not flexible and are difficult to maintain as the project size increases.
This fun project idea came to my mind amidst the pandemic — to curate a list of popular movies that I can watch. Check out the TMdb website here: https://www.themoviedb.org/movie
Have you watched all the popular movies trending? If not — let’s find out!!
We’ll be using the packages:
Requests — for downloading the HTML code from the TMdb URL
BeautifulSoup4 — for extracting data from the HTML string
Pandas — to gather my data into a dataframe for further processing
